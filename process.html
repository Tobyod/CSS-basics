          The best way to improve is probably to practice, and to not be afraid
          to use references when you do not know how to draw something. When
          drawing I personally like to use ibisPaint and Procreate when creating
          digital art, and a mechanical pencil and sketchbook when creating
          traditional art.

            When drawing a scene I usually start by sketching the main focus of
            the drawing e.g. the background or the character followed by any
            other secondary details. Keep in mind a sketch is just a rough
            version of a drawing, so its fine if it isnt perfect.

          <p class="flex-text">
            After the initial sketch you should decide on the main colours/hue
            of the art, so if you want it to be day time night time, and what
            colours you generally wanna use, next you clean up the sketch
            (basically just erasing extra lines and redrawing parts to look
            better if needed)

        <h2 class="content-heading">Basic shading</h2>

            alt=""
            height="400px"
            width="auto"
          />
          <p class="flex-text">
            Next you should add basic shading. Its important to start big and
            focus on finer details later. I recommend using references and
            shapes over lines when shading, also be sure to put more detail into
            parts of the drawing you want to be perceived as closer to add depth
            to your drawings, and to draw your eye to important parts of your
            drawing.

            width="auto"
          />
          <p class="flex-text">
            Basically for this final step I first, add any extra
            lighting/shading details I need, usually to add more contrast, then
            I just go over and add anything else I wanna add e.g. adding
            background elements, adding extra hair detail, eye detail etc this
            is the part where I focus in on stuff since the big picture stuff is
            locked in.
